        ups, confirmations, and unenrollments of volunteers. Additionally, the system 
        provided seamless integration with the organization's volunteer reward program 
        by allowing administrators to grant complimentary ski passes to those who

        description: `Implemented an undirected graph data structure to efficiently map each state 
        from the input file to an integer vertex. By utilizing this graph, the program 
        effectively establishes edges between neighboring states that share a common 
        border. As a result, the output file generated by the program listed each state 
        along with its respective bordering states.`

        description: `Using a binary search tree, the program analyzes COVID-19 data from all 
        countries daily, starting from the beginning of the pandemic up to 9/22/2022. 
        Upon reading the input data from a CSV file, the program then stores the 
        information in a minimum priority queue for each country. The top three highest 
        daily new cases for each country are then saved and placed in a single binary 
        search tree. To generate the output TXT file, the program sorts the binary search 
        tree in ascending order by new cases for a single day and writes the results to 
        the file. Each output entry contains information about the continent, country, day 
        of the highest number of cases, total COVID-19 cases on that day, current 
        number of COVID-19 cases on that day, and the population of the country on that 
        day.
